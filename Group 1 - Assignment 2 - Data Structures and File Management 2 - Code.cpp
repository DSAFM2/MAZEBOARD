        the values that the game requires (i.e. the game level [which mazeboard to read from] and
        the desired location the player would like to move to [the row and column values]) then
        perform the necessary checks using the "isValid" function and "isExit" function (see above).

        If "isValid" and "isExit" are both true, the game prompts the user that they have won.
        If "isValid" is true but "isExit" is false, the game moves the player to the new location.
        If "isValid" is false, the player does not move at all and is prompted to move elsewhere.

        The following code is an implementation of the above as well as specifying what mazeboard
        to read from.
